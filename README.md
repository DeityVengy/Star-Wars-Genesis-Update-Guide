# Star Wars Genesis Update Guide

### Updating Star Wars Genesis is pretty similar to installing it for the first time. This guide assumes you followed my 3 folder method in your root drive as shown below:

1. Download [Star Wars Genesis V5.wabbajack](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m2463OglLXVJ0esVAMPtXvWgvyVyfbSn?usp=drive_link) and place it in your **COMPILER** folder, replacing the existing one.
2. Run Wabbajack.exe from the **WABBAJACK** folder.
3. Click the gear icon (settings) on the top left, then logon to Nexus Mods. Even if you're already logged in, log out and log back in. **Trust me**
4. Go back to the Wabbajack Main Menu and select **Install From Disk**
5. Check the overwrite box

6. Match everything to this (remember the drive letter like K, C, etc should match yours, not mine):

8. Start the install. If you don't have Nexus Premium, it'll ask you to update a small amount of mods manually. If you have Nexus Premium, this should take a couple seconds to minutes.


### Once the install is finished, simply launch ModOrganizer.exe and launch the game as you normally would.
